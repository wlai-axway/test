# Axway-Open-Docs

Axway-Open-Docs is a docs-as-code implementation for Axway documentation. It is built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator with the [Google Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme. The site is deployed on Netlify at <https://axway-open-docs.netlify.app/>. Users can edit any documentation page using GitHub web UI or a WYSIWYG editor provided by [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/).

This repository contains all files for building and deploying a **microsite** in the Axway-Open-Docs ecosystem.

## Create your own microsite using this repository

This section details how to create your own microsite in the Axway-Open-Docs ecosystem. For an overall view of the microsite architecture, see [Architecture for docs-as-code at scale](https://techweb.axway.com/confluence/display/RDAPI/Architecture+for+docs+as+code+at+scale).

### Before you start

You must have the following installed in your development environment:

* Git client
* Hugo
* Node.js

See [Set up and work locally](https://confluence.axway.com/display/RIE/Set+up+and+work+locally) for information on recommended versions of these tools and for tips on installing them in a WSL environment.

The following steps assume that you already have a GitHub account in the Axway org and that you have the permissions to create new projects in that org.

### Create a new microsite repository in Axway org

1. Go to [Axway org on GitHub](https://github.com/Axway) and click **New**.
    ![Create new repo](/static/Images/axway_github_new.png)
2. At the top of the page click **Import a repository**.
    ![Import repo](/static/Images/axway_github_import.png)
3. On the next screen, enter the clone URL of this repository and the name for your new microsite.

    * To find the clone URL of this repository, click the drop-down arrow on the Code button above and copy the HTTPS URL to your clipboard.
    * Enter a name following the naming convention `MYPROJECT-docs`, for example `platform-management-docs`.

    {{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}} When Axway Open Docs was implemented, the naming convention was MYPROJECT-open-docs so you will see earlier projects with that previous naming convention.{{% /alert %}}

    ![Import details](/static/Images/axway_github_import_details.png)

### Clone the new microsite repository to your local environment

Clone your new repository:

```
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:Axway/MYPROJECT-docs.git
```

After running these commands, you will have a local copy of the repository in the following location:

```
/home/YOUR-UNIX-USERNAME/MYPROJECT-docs
```

### Build the site locally

Run the `build.sh` command in your site root:

```
cd ~/MYPROJECT-docs/
./build.sh
```

The `build.sh` script performs the following:

* Adds the `docsy` theme Git submodule
* Adds the `axway-open-docs-common` Git submodule
* Installs the npm packages required by Docsy
* Runs the `hugo server` command

The website is now available locally at `http://localhost:1313/`.

### Create a new Netlify microsite

Create a new site from your microsite repo in Netlify:

1. Log in to [OpenDocs Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com/teams/opendocs/sites).
2. Click **New site from Git**.
3. Click **GitHub**. You'll be asked to authorize Netlify to your account.
4. On the **Create a new site** dialog, select the **Axway** GitHub organization, and then select **Configure the Netlify app on GitHub**.

    ![Select GitHub repo](/static/Images/netlify_select_repo.png)

5. Click **Update access**.

6. The **Create a new site** for your GitHub repo page appears with a list of site settings. Leave the default settings (**Open docs team** as Owner, **master** as branch to deploy, build command `bash build.sh -n.` and publish directory is **public**), and then click **Deploy site**.

    ![Add site to Netlify](/static/Images/netlify_deploy_site.png)

The site is now deployed on a random URL. To change the URL click **Site settings > Change site name** and enter a name in the format `MYPROJECT`. The site will now be available on the URL `https://MYPROJECT-docs.netlify.app/`.

### Add deploy preview as comment to pull requests

Enable the Netlify deploy preview comment for pull requests at once. In the site settings, on the left menu click **Build & deploy** > **Deploy notifications**, and verify that 'Add Deploy Preview notifications as pull request comments when Deploy Preview succeeds' is on the list. If it isn't, add it by clicking **Add notification**.

This adds a **deploy/netlify** status check that you must add to your branch's protection rules in your GitHub repo. See the [Add rules to protect branches](#add-rules-to-protect-branches) section for details on enabling them in your GitHub repo.

### Customize the site to use your Github repo and test the GitHub edit links

Change the `github_repo` parameter in `config.toml` to point to your project repo as this is used by Hugo/Docsy to generate the GitHub edit links on each page. For example:

```
github_repo = "https://github.com/Axway/MYPROJECT-docs"
```

When this is complete, test the **Edit on GitHub** links on your microsite and verify that they link to the Github repo for your microsite.

### Customize the site to use your Netlify CMS instance and test the CMS edit links

Make the following changes to get the **Edit on Netlify CMS** links on each page to link to the correct Netlify CMS app. The Netlify CMS app is available by default on the URL  `https://MYPROJECT-docs.netlify.app/admin/`.

#### Change baseURL in `config.toml` to the URL of your microsite

Change the `baseURL` in `config.toml`:

```
baseURL = "https://MYPROJECT-docs.netlify.app/"
```

#### Update the Netlify CMS configuration for your repository and microsite

Change `repo` and `site_url` in `static/admin/config.js` to point to your GitHub repo and your microsite.

```
repo: 'Axway/MYPROJECT-docs', //Path to your GitHub repository.
...
site_url: 'https://MYPROJECT-docs.netlify.app/', //URL to Netlify site
```

#### Add the Axway GitHub OAuth app to your microsite

To enable users to log in to Netlify CMS with their GitHub accounts, you must add the Axway OAuth authentication provider to the microsite.

1. Log in to [OpenDocs Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com/teams/opendocs/sites).
2. Click your microsite.
3. Go to **Settings > Access control > OAuth**.
4. Click **Install provider**.
5. Select **GitHub** as the provider and enter the client ID and secret from [this internal Confluence page](https://techweb.axway.com/confluence/display/RDAPI/Open+docs+quick+reference#Opendocsquickreference-OAuthproviderdetailsforNetlifyCMS).
6. Click **Install**.

#### Test the CMS edit links

When this is complete, test the **Edit on Netlify CMS** links on your microsite and verify that they link to the CMS instance for your microsite. You should see someting like this:

![Netlify CMS editor](/static/Images/netlifycms_editor.jpg)

### Customize the content for your project

The project contains placeholder documentation content in the folder `/content/en/docs` and placeholder images in `/static/Images`. The placeholder content is copied from the [Docsy example project](https://example.docsy.dev/) (with some modifications) and shows the different types of content and the different types of formatting that are available for you to use when creating your own content.

You must replace or update the placeholder content as necessary with your own documentation content.

When working with the content it can be useful to read the following Docsy documentation to get an understanding of how to add content files and images, and how to change the navigation of the content using frontmatter fields in Markdown files:

* [Adding Content](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/content/)
* [Navigation and Search](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/navigation/)

### Customize the microsite landing page

The landing page for the microsite is a HTML page `content/en/_index.html` and uses Docsy content blocks. You must modify this page to create your own blocks and link to your own content.

### Update the Netlify CMS collections configuration for your documentation

After you have replaced the placeholder content with your documentation content, you must update the `collections` variable in `static/admin/config.js` so that Netlify CMS shows one collection for each folder under `content\en\docs`.

For more information, see [Add new documentation to Netlify CMS](https://axway-open-docs.netlify.app/docs/contribution_guidelines/maintain_customize/#add-new-documentation-to-netlify-cms).

When this is complete, test the **Edit on Netlify CMS** links again on your microsite and verify that the CMS shows all of your documentation content.

### Set up publishing to Zoomin

To enable publishing of the microsite content as a new _bundle_ on the Zoomin production doc portal you must create a classification file, properties file, and zip file as detailed in [Docs-as-code on Zoomin](https://techweb.axway.com/confluence/display/RDAPI/Docs-as-code+on+Zoomin).

When this is set, up manually FTP the zip file to Zoomin to trigger an upload of the Netlify microsite content. After you have verified the upload was successful and the documentation published as expected, do the following to automate the publishing process.

1. Upload the classification and properties files to the [opendocs-gitlab repository](https://git.ecd.axway.org/documentation/opendocs-gitlab). This is the source repository for maintaining these files.

2. Submit a ticket to the [R&D API Dev (RDAPI)](https://jira.axway.com/projects/RDAPI/issues/RDAPI-25390?filter=allopenissues) Jira project to request that your project be added as a job to the [Jenkins Open Docs project](https://apigw-builder.lab.dubl.axway.int/view/OpenDocs/) with access to deploy the job. Clone or refer to [RDAPI-25716](https://jira.axway.com/browse/RDAPI-25716?) as an example.

3. After the ticket is completed and you have access to deploy the job, sign into the [Jenkins Open Docs project](https://apigw-builder.lab.dubl.axway.int/view/OpenDocs/), click your project, and then click **Build with Parameters**. Select your doc portal environment (staging or production, and then click **Build**.

### Remove documentation content from main Axway-Open-Docs repo (optional)

If your content was migrated from the main Axway-Open-Docs site to a microsite, you must now:

* Remove all documentation content and images from the main site
* Update the Zoomin classification file for the main site to remove the migrated content
* Update the Netlify CMS config file for the main site to remove any collections for the migrated content

### Connect your microsite to the Axway-Open-Docs ecosystem

This must be done after any content in Axway-Open-Docs repo has been removed.

When you and your stakeholders are happy with the content on your Netlify microsite, you can request that your microsite be added to the overall ecosystem.

This involves:

1. Adding a new link for your documentation to the home page (`content/en/_index.html`) of the main [Axway Open Documentation](https://axway-open-docs.netlify.app/) site
2. Adding redirects to the `netlify.toml` file in the main site to redirect clicks on the new link for your documentation to your microsite

Redirects must be added to the `netlify.toml` file in [Axway Open Docs repo](https://github.com/Axway/axway-open-docs). You might need redirect for each of the following:

* Documentation content (for example, `/docs/streams/*`)
* Images (for example, `/Images/streams/*`)
* CMS links (for example, `/admin/#/edit/streams/*`) **One redirect for each Netlify CMS collection**

Here is an example of the redirects added for AMPLIFY Shared Services:

```
[[redirects]]
  from = "/docs/shared_services/*"
  to = "https://amplifysharedservices-open-docs.netlify.app/docs/shared_services/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
  headers = {X-From = "Netlify"}

[[redirects]]
  from = "/admin/#/edit/shared_services/*"
  to = "https://amplifysharedservices-open-docs.netlify.app/admin/#/edit/shared_services/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
  headers = {X-From = "Netlify"}

[[redirects]]  
  from = "/admin/#/edit/supportapi/*"
  to = "https://amplifysharedservices-open-docs.netlify.app/admin/#/edit/supportapi/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
  headers = {X-From = "Netlify"}

[[redirects]]
  from = "/admin/#/edit/methods/*"
  to = "https://amplifysharedservices-open-docs.netlify.app/admin/#/edit/methods/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
  headers = {X-From = "Netlify"}

[[redirects]]
  from = "/admin/#/edit/formats/*"
  to = "https://amplifysharedservices-open-docs.netlify.app/admin/#/edit/formats/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
  headers = {X-From = "Netlify"}
```

Here is an example of a redirect for images:

```
[[redirects]]
  from = "/Images/streams/*"
  to = "https://amplifystreams-open-docs.netlify.app/Images/streams/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
  headers = {X-From = "Netlify"}
```

### Test the main site and microsite

After the redirects have been implemented, and any content removed from the main site (if applicable), you must test the redirects according to the following criteria:

1. Any links to the microsite content from the main site `https://axway-open-docs.netlify.app/` work correctly
2. Edit on Github links in the microsite content brings user to microsite Git repo
3. Edit on CMS links in microsite content brings user to CMS instance containing microsite collections only
4. No broken links are found in either the main site or the microsite
5. Microsite content appears on Zoomin as a separate bundle and is no longer part of Axway Open Documentation bundle
6. GA, Hotjar, Algolia search works as before on main site and microsite

### Customize your Git repo for your way of working

You can set up your Git repo in whatever way works best for your team and your product, however, to be accepted into the Axway-Open-Docs ecosystem you must enable the following as a minimum.

#### Configure Dependabot alerts and security updates

You must configure dependabot alerts and security updates for your microsite repository. GitHub's Dependabot creates pull requests, alerts, and sends email notifications when a dependency needs to be upgraded in your project because a dependency has introduced a security risk.

1. In your GitHub microsite project, click **Settings**.
2. Click **Security & analysis**.
3. Enable **Dependabot alerts** and **Dependabot security updates**. The button next to the setting says **Disable** when enabled.
4. Click **Save changes**.

#### Add rules to protect branches

You must add rules to protect the `master` branch. Type the branch name pattern `master` and then enable the following rules:

* Require pull request reviews before merging (at least 1 review from a technical writer or doc owner)
* Require status checks to pass before merging. The following status checks are required for pull requests:
    * **Axway/cla** - A check that verifies the contributor has signed the Axway CLA.
    * **MarkdownChecks** - A check against the `markdownlinst.json` file to verify the Markdown adheres to the rules. This is dependent on the `ciworkflow.yml` file and enabling **Actions** for the repo. When both are configured Markdown linting is performed. If the Markdown does not pass the rules specified in the linter file, that status check is unable to pass, which blocks the pull request. See [Markdown linting](#markdown-linting).
    * **Header rules** - A Netlify check for Netlify site custom headers.
    * **Pages changed** - A Netlify check that indicates how many files have been uploaded to the Netlify CDN.
    * **Redirect rules** - A Netlify check for redirect URLs configured for Netlify in the `netlify.toml` file.
    * **Mixed content** - A Netlify check for mixed content (when initial HTML is loaded over a secure HTTPS connection, but other resources such as images, videos, stylesheets, scripts are loaded over an insecure HTTP connection).
    * **deploy/netlify** - A Netlify check to create a Netlify deploy preview. The **deploy/netlify** check is dependent on adding the **Add Deploy Preview notifications to commits when Deploy Preview succeeds** notification in Netlify. See [Add deploy preview as comment to pull requests](#add-deploy-preview-as-comment-to-pull-requests) for details. If you do not add this notification, the **deploy/netlify** status check is unable to pass, which blocks the pull request.
* Require linear history

![Branch protections](/static/Images/microsite_github_protections.png)

#### Markdown linting

You must use the GitHub Action that runs the Markdown linter (see `.github/workflows/ciworkflow.yml`).

Markdown linting and checks are completed when a PR is submitted after all configuration is completed. The following is required to enable MarkdownChecks.

* **markdownlint.json**: A file in each repo that specifies the Markdown linter rules.
* **ciworkflow.yml**: A workflow to run Markdown linting on the PR content against the `markdownlint.json` rules file.
* **GitHub Actions**: Click the **Actions** tab for the repo and enable workflows. This enables running the workflows saved in the `.github/workflows` folder. If you do not enable workflow actions, then the workflows will not run and the check for the MarkdownChecks will not execute.

#### Verify required status checks and workflows are executing

After you have configured your repo and you are ready to complete pull requests, you must verify that the required status checks and workflows are executing. You can verify it by the following ways:

*When a PR is submitted, but before it is merged*:

1. Create a PR and wait for the status checks to complete.
2. Make sure you see the required checks and that they have passed.

![GitHub Pull Request Status](/static/Images/github_pr_status.png)

*After a PR is completed and has been merged*:

1. Click a Closed PR.
2. Click the **Checks** menu.
3. Make sure you see the required checks.

![GitHub Pull Request Checks](/static/Images/github_pr_checks.png)

#### Merge strategy

It is best to use a squash merging strategy in public projects with external contributors as this results in a more readable Git history and cleaner change history messages at the bottom of each documentation page.

To enable squash merging, select the **Allow squash merging** checkbox and deselect the other options under **Settings > Options > Merge button**. When using this option it is best to also enable the linear history requirement on any protected branches.

You can also enable **Automatically delete head branches** to keep your branch list clean.

#### Branching strategy

You can set up any branching strategy as required by your product team.

Some common options include:

* A single production branch (`master`) for single version continuously delivered products
* A development branch (`develop`) and a production branch (`master`) for single version products delivered on a regular cycle
* A latest version production branch (`master`) and one or more previous version sustaining production branches (`762`, `753`, etc.)

#### Project maintainers and CODEOWNERS

You must add the appropriate users as maintainers of the GitHub repo under **Settings > Manage access**. Users must have write access as a minimum to review and approve pull requests. It is best to have at least two maintainers.

Next, modify the CODEOWNERS (`.github/CODEOWNERS`) file with the appropriate users. This automates who gets added as reviewers in pull requests. You can globally add all maintainers as codeowners or opt for specific owners for specific files or directories as shown in the file comments.

#### Pull request and issue templates

It is best to modify the following templates to suit your project:

* Pull request template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) - This template is used when a contributor creates a PR on GitHub. It is not used by Netlify CMS.
* Issue templates (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation-issue-template.md` and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/website-issue-template.md`) - These are used when a contributor creates a GitHub issue.

### Update the microsite repo README.md

When everything is tested and you are ready to make your repo available to contributors, update the `README.md` file in the root of the microsite repo to explain to contributors what your microsite contains, how it fits into the overall Axway-Open-Docs ecosystem, and how they can contribute. You can use something similar to the README in <https://github.com/Axway/axway-open-docs>.
